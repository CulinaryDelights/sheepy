                    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Sheepy was born at a young age. When he was 9, his parents abandoned him in a fast food restaurant. So there was one thing Sheepy spent his time doing--eating burgers. He got pretty gosh darn good at eating burgers, which came in handy when the Swedish government began hiring burger eaters to get rid of their burger infestation. Since Sheepy was a patriotic US citizen, he was the first one to help out the Swedes. After his time cleaning up Sweden, Sheepy returned to his home in the south of western New Zealand.

                    <h2>Early Life</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p> For the next 3 years, Sheepy was unemployed. After 2 of those 3 years had gone by, Sheepy was evicted and spent the next year livin' off the land. During his time in the great outdoors, Sheepy created a method to build a burger out of nothing but grass, mud, and tree bark. He patented the recipe and made lots of money off of it by selling it to non-profits who then taught starving children in the suburbs of Miami how to make them. Since he now had lots of money  he moved back to the US and he decided to buy Five Guys. This was an overly ambitious idea which did not pan out in any way, shape, or form. But, it did succeed in wasting several years of Sheepy's life and millions of his precious dollars. </p>

                    <h2>Later Life</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Now that sheepy was stuck in a studio apartment in New York with $7.54 to his name, he decided that he needed more money. He turned to the one thing he knew most, burger eating. So, he decided to join the new industry of burger safety testers. Sheepy loved it. From the thrill of not knowing whether the next burger he ate would be the best ground round he'd ever touched his teeth to, or contain high doses of cyanide. Plus, he made 8 cents more than minimum wage. At the factory he met his wife Sheepy. They dated for a short period of time and were promptly married. After a few years, Sheepy had 2 children named Sheepy and Sheepy. Sheepy's family now live happily in their home in a factory farm in Iowa and are living a great life. Sheepy knows his time is running out since he will be slaughtered soon, but he is enjoying the time he has left to its fullest extent.</p>
